# PointOfSalesDatabase
As a part of our 3rd Semester Database Management System Course, we created a Point Of Sales (POS) Program using C# and SQL. It is fully functional and can be connected to a database. An Entity Relationship Diagram
is also included which can be used to understand the flow of the program.
